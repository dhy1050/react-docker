# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## docker and docker composer command to run the cotainer
### docker
`docker ps -a`
check all containers

`docker image ls`
check and list all images

`docker image rm [image id]`
rm the image with id

`docker build -t react-image .`
build an image called react-image in current directory from file Dockerfile

`docker rm react-app -f`
force remove the containter react-app

`docker run -d --env-file ./.env -v localdirectory:contianerdirectory:ro -p 4000:3000 --name react-app react-image`
run container react-app based on image react-image, connect local port 3000 to contienr 4000, and sync local directory(need full path of local directory) to container directory, :ro tell that in container, can only read; use ./.env as env file for the container to use any evironment vairable.

`docker exec -it react-app bash`
docker interact the container react-app and go to container bash



`docker system prune`
WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - unused build cache

### docker composer
`docker-compose up`
docker composer find the file docker-compose.yml and run through it to make the image and run it to start up containers

`docker-compose down`
stop container and delete the container in the docker-composer.yml file, however the images and volumes will still remain

`docker-composer down --rmi all -v`
this will delete all images and volumes as well
